## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Sound Synthesizer part is a bit confusing. For now, I just used the provided code without deep understanding. It would require some research to understand how that part works. If I knew that I would use sounds in my projects, I would spend time on learning about it. Since it is not a common feature for web apps (except for games perhaps), I gave it a lower priority and focused on completing the project faster. Everything else looked familiar.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I'd love to learn how to publish my website, make it functional, and connect it to databases so that it could actually become a helpful tool and begin making an impact.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I'd implement some additional features to make the game more interesting and engaging. I could make a few variants of the game. For example, after getting a clue, the squares would get hidden and the user would have to recall their positions on a grid. I could also replace the squares with some objects like cars, horses, and teddy bears which would vary in color as the game progresses. And I also could make the game more visually appealing by selecting more attractive fonts, interesting backgrounds, and adding variety to the sounds.]
